# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for programs. 
The reason the community settled with this name is because they either start with a period (e.g. .zshrc) 
or live inside .config, which often (but not always) renders them invisible to your file manager. 
These files can be stored and shared to make configuration for other machines easier.

For example, a fellow Linux user may be interested to have the same styling and settings I use for my terminal
emulator (Alacritty), in which case they'll browse my configuration files, copy the contents, and either use them
as is or adjust them to their needs. Some configuration may also apply for other operating systems (like MacOS),
but due to hardware constraints I'm unable to verify it.

I'll be maintaining a list of fonts and programs I use for each item, to centralize the requirements.
